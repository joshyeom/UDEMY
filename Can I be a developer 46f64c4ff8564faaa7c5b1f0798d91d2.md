# Can I be a developer?

## Do All The Exercises

The single most important piece of advice I have

## Don’t Just Copy

It’s very easy to go through this course, mindlessly
typing what I type. Ask questions. Study! Practice!

Treat this like a bootcamp rather than a series of videos.

## Take your time!

Many students want to rush through the course, but remember this is 10-12 weeks of full-time coursework.

Slow down and focus on learning and practicing the concepts, rather than rushing to complete sections.

## Don’t panic

Almost everyone hits a rough patch in the course at some point. Don’t let it discourage you. It’s normal!

DO NOT SPIN YOUR WHEELS!

## Take breaks!

Please take breaks away from the course and ideally away from the computer. This course is a lot!

At my bootcamps, we go for walks, play ping pong, and pet the class dogs. If we don’t take breaks, I can immediately see the impact on students.
